# [PLNet](https://ieeecai.org/2024/wp-content/pdfs/540900b095/540900b095.pdf): Light Recipe Design for Indoor Farming through Generative Deep Learning
This repository includes official implementation of PLNet. 
PLNet utilizes a generative neural network, trained on plant growth data, to generate light recipes that are expected to result in high biomass yields.
The code assumes the availability of a pre-trained biomass estimator prior to the training of PLNet.
